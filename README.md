Welcome to the repository of my master thesis

Here is a quick description of the structure of the repository : 

1- Promise12-Final : in this folder you can find all the codes that were used to solve the prostate segmentation task

2- ProstateX-Final : in this folder you can find all the codes that were used to solve the lesion detection/classification task

3- Traces : this folder contains all the codes that I built for testing some features or some methods, but that did not make it into the final code becaues they were not good ennough, or because they were just meant to be used only for testing some other functionalities. It is important to note that many methods were used before reaching the final U-Net architecture and final preprocessing steps, and its in this folder "Traces" that you can find all the different struggles that I went through to finally get the final version of my code

4- The Pipleline.py is the code that connects both models
